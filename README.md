# bolker-labs

This repository contains modified labs that belong to Bolker's Ecological Modelling and Data Analysis in R. The original labs can be found at:
https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/emdbook/


Labs have been modified by several people (Bob Douma, Alejandro Morales Sierra, Wopke van der Werf, Lia Hemerik, Joost van Heerwaarden) over the years to increase clarity, make them up-to-date with the most recent developments and match the learning goals of the course "Ecological modelling and Data Analysis in R" https://ssc.wur.nl/Studiegids/Vak/CSA-34306.
