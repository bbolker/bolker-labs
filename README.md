# bolker-labs
This repository contains modified labs that belong to Bolker's Ecological Modelling and Data Analysis in R. Labs have been modified over the years to increase clarity, make them up-to-date with the most recent developments and match the learning goals of the course "Ecological modelling and Data Analysis in R" https://ssc.wur.nl/Studiegids/Vak/CSA-34306. The labs can be used or modified freely.
