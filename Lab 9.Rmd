## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
# test dataset five for differences between groups
dat = data.frame(x,y,group)
te = function(par,dat){
  a = par[1]
  b = par[2:3]
  ymean = a*exp(-b[dat$group]*dat$x)
  nll = -sum(dpois(dat$y,lambda=ymean),log=T)
  return(nll)
}

par=c(4,0.2,0.2)
opt1 = optim(par=par,fn=te,dat=dat)

te1 = function(par,dat){
  a = par[1]
  b = par[2]
  ymean = a*exp(-b*dat$x)
  nll = -sum(dpois(dat$y,lambda=ymean),log=T)
  return(nll)
}
par=c(4,0.2)
opt2 = optim(par=par,fn=te1,dat=dat)


```
